# Classic-ML-Algorithms
Using KNN, Logistical regression, and SVM algorthims we can see the differences in how each of these algorithms effects the analysis of the data, to determine outcomes on what would be the grade for a student given certain features about their grades in different parts of the course. 

Naive Bayes: to check while assuming each feature is unrelated to eachother and have little impact on eachother. Must be used as a supervised learning alogirthm given a test and experimental dataset to track accuracy.
